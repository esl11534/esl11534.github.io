<p>John Mayer is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer. He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and raised in nearby Fairfield. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, but disenrolled and moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1997.
In my opinion, John Mayer has some of the most lyrically complex songs that have been produced the last 15 years, and his songs mean so much to me.  They are extremely relatable and musically intricate.</p>
<p>
Some of my favorite John Mayer songs are:
<ol>
<li>Gravity</li>
<li>Wonderland</li>
<li>Daughters</li>
<li>Neon</li>
</ol>
