<p>Hey everyone! I am glad you stopped by my site. I am a sophomore at UGA, majoring in Marketing and Minoring in Spanish. I am an active member in a variety of clubs and organizations around campus, and love to read and listen to music in my spare time.  Because I am a Spanish minor, I am planning on studying abroad in Spain next summer, 
and am visiting many different cities while I am there, including <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/spain/valencia-and-murcia/valencia">Valencia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C&aacute;diz">Cadiz</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville">Sevilla</a>. 
I am so excited!</p>

<h2>Delta Zeta- Zeta Pi</h2>

<p>I am an active member in my sorority here at UGA, <a href="http://www.georgiadeltazeta.com/">Delta Zeta</a>. Currently, I live in the sorority house here on campus with 70 other girls! I am the Recruitment Assistant for Delta Zeta, meaning that I help recruit other girls to join our sisterhood!  Joining a sorority was truly the best decision I have ever made in college.
Though we have diverse interests, we truly share an unbreakable bond of 
friendship that lasts beyond the college years.</p>

<h2>John Mayer</h2>

<p>I love the music of John Mayer. 
I have created a page dedicated to him. <a href="john-mayer.html">Check it out!</a></p>
